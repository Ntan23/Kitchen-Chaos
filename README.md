# Kitchen-Chaos
 
Kitchen Chaos is a simple cooking game. In this game , I am learning to use SOLID principles to my code and also some code styles and naming rules.

In this game , I use all of my script with Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) except for "Detector.cs" script, I use Interface Segregation Principles (ISP). 

SRP Principles Examples (PlayerController.cs) :
